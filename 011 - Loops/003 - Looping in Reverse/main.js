// Looping in Reverse

// What if we want the for loop to log 3, 2, 1, and then 0? With simple modifications to the expressions, we can make our loop run backward!

// To run a backward for loop, we must:

//     Set the iterator variable to the highest desired value in the initialization expression.
//     Set the stopping condition for when the iterator variable is less than the desired amount.
//     The iterator should decrease in intervals after each iteration.

// We’ll practice by changing the for we wrote previously to now go in reverse. When writing/changing loops, there is a chance that our stopping condition isn’t met and we get a dreaded infinite loop which essentially stops our programming from running anything else! To exit out of an infinite loop in an exercise, refresh the page - then fix the code for your loop.

// 1. Make a for loop that loops backwards printing 3 to 0 to the console. Use the >= comparison operator in your stopping condition and the -- operator in your iteration statement.

// The loop below loops from 0 to 3. Edit it to loop backwards from 3 to 0
for (let counter = 3; counter >= 0; counter--){
    console.log(counter);
  }
