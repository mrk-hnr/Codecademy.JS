// Create an Array

// One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets []. Remember from the previous exercise, arrays can store any data type — we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types. 

//             IMAGE NOT AVAILABLE

// Let’s take a closer look at the syntax in the array example:
// * The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
// * Each content item inside an array is called an element. 
// * There are three different elements inside the array.
// * Each element inside the array is a different data type. 

// We can also save an array to a variable. You may have noticed we did this in the previous exercise:
//     let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

// Let’s practice by making an array of our own.

// 1.  Declare a variable using const named hobbies and set it equal to an array with three strings inside of it.
// 2. Use console.log() to print hobbies to the console.

const hobbies = ["sleeping", "eating", "gaming"]

console.log(hobbies)
